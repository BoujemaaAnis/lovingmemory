      <p><em>Thursday 28th January 2021</em> Due to COVID-19 the services are restricted in the number of people allowed. The plan is to live stream the services so everyone who wants to attend will be able to do so virtually. We will also hold a get together at a later date when COVID-19 restrictions are relaxed.</p>
      <p class="highlight">Those who are able to attend please be aware that it was Lyn's wish that people not wear black at her funeral, so feel free to dress as colourfully as you like.</p>
