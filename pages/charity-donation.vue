      <p>Instead of flowers we would like to suggest people make a donation to one of the following charities</p>
      <h2>Marie Curie</h2>
      <p>We are so grateful to Marie Curie for supporting Lyn in her final days and making sure she was as 
        comfortable and peaceful as possible when the end came.

      <h2>Make a Wish</h2>
      <p>Lyn loved children and would have loved something or other</p>
